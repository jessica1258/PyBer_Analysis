# PyBer Ridesharing Analysis

# Overview
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a graphical summary of rideshare fares over the time frame from 01/01/2019 to 07/29/2019. The data covered a sample of rides in cities that which were categorized as Urban, Suburban and Rural with the intent of understanding rate differences by those three categories.
## Approach
The analylsis required the use of two separate data sources for city data (city_data.csv) and ride data(ride_data.csv). The city data contained the name of the city, the driver count for the city and the type of city, either Urban, Suburban or Rural. The ride data contained the city name, the data of the ride, the fare paid and the ride_id. The city name was used as the key to match the two data sets, which allowed for the type of city to be associated with each ride.
